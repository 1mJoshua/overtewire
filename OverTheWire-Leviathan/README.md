# OverTheWire-Leviathan

[Leviathan](http://overthewire.org/wargames/leviathan/) is a wargame hosted on the OverTheWire platform, designed to test and improve your skills in system exploitation and privilege escalation. In this game, you progress through a series of levels by solving challenges that involve understanding and manipulating binary executables with escalating difficulty.

Each level in Leviathan has its unique binary executable file and a set of permissions that restrict access to certain resources and files. To advance to the next level, you must find and exploit vulnerabilities in the current level's binary to obtain the password required for access to the next level.
